Year,Model ,Review
2009,Honda,"Although arguably the first-generation Insight’s hybrid powertrain and unique styling made it ahead of its time, the rebirth of the Insight with this second-generation model is designed for much greater global appeal"
2009,Honda,"2009 Honda Accord EX-L 4  : This car is very comfortable & sporty for 4 cylinders! It has the best transmission of any car I've had for 43 years, which were about 42 cars!"
2010,Honda,"I have owed and driven Honda products for 20 years. Until I purchased this vehicle on March 27, 2010 I was a true Honda fanatic. After ending up with this piece of junk I will never do business with Honda again. Not just their automobiles, but all of their products.  The seats are extremely uncomfortable, becoming very apparent after 15 minutes or so. The worst thing is the headrest. It leans very far forward. Your head is bent down and your shoulders forced off the seat. Just try driving like that for more than 5 minutes at a time. I was forced to either remove the headrests, or park the car. The dealer and American Honda were both useless in attempting to find a way to correct this situation. (the headrest is only adjustable up and down, not in any other direction)"
2010,Honda,"Honda Accord Euro L : The seats are average, but there is very little rear legroom for tall passengers. All I can say is I'm glad this car is covered by a warranty."
2011,Honda, Honda HR-V: Continuous variable transmission failed. $5000 to replace. Ended up selling to the wreckers.
2011,Honda,"Not much has changed with the historically second-best-selling Honda, and some change is way overdue. Honda's peculiar non-planetary five-speed automatic has the smallest ratio spread in the test, contributing to its back-of-the-pack performance ratings and worst-in-class EPA economy rankings of 21/31 mpg city/highway"
2012,Honda,"Honda Ballade 150 1.5: This is the most reliable car I have ever had. It is very comfortable on long trips. It is not a pocket rocket, but cruises comfortably at 120km per hour. It has never let me down with major problems. Road holding is very good for such an old vehicle. The gearbox has to be used if you need to maintain good average speeds in hilly country. I have never had wheel alignment done on this car, and I rotate the front and back tyres every 15000 km. I get an average of 55000+ km on a set of tyres. The tyres wear off evenly even after 26 years of driving."
2012,Honda,"Ride quality is top-notch, though communication with the road is minimal. Still, such a relaxed demeanor is probably what many buyers want. Though not the quietest car in our test, this is easily the quietest Accord ever -- a huge step forward for Honda."
2013,Honda,"Honda Jazz Hybrid 1.4 : This is my second Honda, the first one being a Honda Civic LS saloon.
This is my first Hybrid with a CVT gearbox, not as good as a conventional automatic, but certainly a lot better than that awful I-Shift. My main problem with the car, is its lack of power. When I need to put my foot down to overtake on the motorway, the engine screams with high revs, but the car doesn't move very fast; I suppose that this is an inherent problem with a CVT gearbox. I had previously driven cars, both the Honda Jazz I-shift and Toyota Corolla MMT, and they were truly horrible to drive, with jerky gear changes, rolling backwards at traffic lights, and I understand quite unreliable as well. My car is made in Japan, is quite comfortable, roomy and quiet inside with very clever storage and seating options. All in all, I am very satisfied, if a little disappointed with its performance potential."
2013,Honda,"The CR-V's voluminous cargo area, quick-folding seats, flat floor, low cargo-load height, and wide, easy-to-open liftgate catapulted it to staff favorite status. It became the default support vehicle for many a producer of the numerous Motor Trend photo/video productions. The Honda got lots of attention from staffers who needed a practical machine for all the car testing, photo shooting, and television filming we tackle on a daily basis."
2014,Honda,"Honda Ballade 150i 16v: The car really rides very comfortably, although the steering has started creaking a bit. It has a powerful feel to it for a 1990 150 16v. The fuel consumption is very light."
2014,Honda,"A CUV built to a very specific taste. It makes every trip feel more adventurous, but never luxurious."
2015,Honda,"The CR-V isn't the most fun to drive, most efficient, or most feature-rich car in its segment, but very few five-seat crossovers do as many things as well as this Honda. It's not perfect, but even in the second half of its life, the CR-V is worth considering for most buyers."
2015,Honda,"Honda Accord EX-L 4:  Nothing major has gone wrong, other than the fact that it burns a LOT of oil. Be careful if you're looming to buy a Honda. This model, as well as many others, has serious problems with burning oil. For those that don't know, burning oil is akin to heart disease and needing a quadruple bypass. Your engine does not get the lubrication it needs, and friction wears it out extremely quickly, necessitating the replacement of the engine."
2016,Honda,"2016 Honda Civic S 1.4 : The interior of the car is a very nice and comfortable. The driver's seat has good lumbar and lateral support, plenty of legroom and the steering wheel has a good range of height and reach. The quality of the cabin materials and fit and finish is of a high standard and everything is where you would expect it to be. The downside of the cabin is that the car sits very low; I'm 6' 1"" (185 cm) and have a bad back. Every time I got into the car, I felt the strain, particularly if I was in a car park and could not open the door all the way and so had to twist as well as lower myself. That was very uncomfortable. It hurt! Another annoyance is that there are no cup holders. There are sort of pseudo cup holders in the door map pockets, but they are awkwardly placed down low and under the arm rests, and don't really securely fit your drinks anyway.                                                                                         Overall, except for the visibility issues, it's a good city car that can fit plenty of junk, but with the 1.4 engine, it's not exactly the best highway cruiser, though it is very comfortable to sit and ride in"
2016,Honda,"Our Honda's Pilot is smooth, cushy, and powerful, but the tranny continues to suffer at low speeds,"" he proclaimed. ""Indecisive gear hunting along with getting caught in the wrong gear is its biggest problem"
2017,Honda,"Honda HR-V GH1 1.6: Fell in love with this when I got a 98 one, has been the most comfortable car I've owned. The rest weren't great though, and the engine is so quiet when driving, I sometimes wasn't sure it was still on. It has served as a mini stealth camper several times, and the dogs love the height for looking out over the landscape; feels very safe to drive."
2017,Honda,"The Honda's angular interior is architectural, only let down by its frustrating infotainment screen (continuing our strident complaints about other Honda vehicles' user interfaces).The Clarity's better design, extra range, sportier handling, and five seats give it the edge."
2018,Honda,"Honda CR-V : Water pump seized, left us stranded on the highway. Dealer took 7 days to fix the problem, leaving us stranded out of town. It is a decent car, but the reliability is questionable."
2018,Honda,"Honda's engineers went to work upgrading the suspension, steering, chassis bracing, and sound deadening to make driving its least expensive car a more refined experience"
2019,Honda,The 2019 Honda Insight marks the return of a dedicated hybrid vehicle in the Japanese automaker's lineup. Touring trim has lower fuel economy rating
2009,Hyundai,"Good, Not Great: Elantra Still Squarely on the Value Side of the Hyundai Ledger"
2009,Hyundai,2009 Hyundai Sonata: Very poor gas mileage - below sticker minimum; service manager says this is normal for Hyundai due to ethanol in all gas - so much for the warranty and federal disclosures!  Car is uncomfortable and heat/air controls unreadable without causing an accident. No miles per gallon indicator. Gas door is cheap plastic and almost came off when I first opened it.
2010,Hyundai,"Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.4 : Well this car is one great family mid-sized sedan, although it feels like a large car.The car has great gas mileage! Although the engine had to be broken in for long period of time, if I drive gently, I get about 6.8L per 100km in the city. That's something for a car this size.The seats are comfy, and the Infinity sound system is just AMAZING, however the suspension is a bit soft for me.All the features on the car work well. The car stops great, and drives marvelously without hassle.Great ride for your buck, although I'd suggest you wait to get a 2011 Sonata. Love that design; more sporty, but however if you like a conservative looking car, this is the car for you."
2010,Hyundai,"One of the most incendiary newcomers is surely the 2011 Hyundai Sonata, resplendent in swoopy four-door-coupe styling and powered by a state-of-the-art direct-injected 2.4-liter engine and six-speed automatic transmission, boasting best-in-class weight-to-power"
2011,Hyundai,"Hyundai Sonata GL 2.4: Nice looking car, comes with heated seats, keyless entry and remote trunk release, nice sound system, good looking interior, spacious, aux outlet, USB connection, 2 12V outlets.Paid 15000 with taxes and everything. Bought it used with 52000kms. It now has 70000, but with the problems I had, I do not think it will last. A lot of rattles coming from the suspension. Nice interior and good quality, but mechanically still needs work.Went today and bought a 2009 Camry. Toyota's quality has dropped, but it is still better than Hyundai's."
2011,Hyundai,"The Santa Fe feels like it's from the old Hyundai, not the new. Visually, the Santa Fe enjoys a few aesthetic tweaks that move it in the right direction, including a new grille, a re-jiggered lower fascia, and refashioned taillights"
2012,Hyundai,2012 Hyundai Santa Fe: The driver's seat takes the prize as the most uncomfortable seat on the planet.
2012,Hyundai,"the Hyundai Accent comes in four-door sedan and hatchback bodystyles. The Accent hatchback is the more expensive version. Four-wheel disc brakes come standard, and Hyundai says they're a class exclusive, as is a sliding armrest in the narrow space between the front seats, and a split fold-down rear seat."
2013,Hyundai," Hyundai Santa Fe Sport: The oil sensor light started intermittently turning off and on, first when the brakes were applied, then it flashed off and on when on a rough road. It would go off for various lengths of time when the ignition was turned off and the vehicle was restarted. Finally it stayed on.

I checked the oil several times, and it was at the full mark. When the light came on permanently, I again checked the oil and it didn't register on the dip-stick. I added oil and then checked to see if I could see any sign of oil in the snow. The oil was running out. I assumed an oil plug leak or a improperly installed filter was leaking. When I took it to the dealer, they informed me that it was a TYPICAL Sante Fe problem; the oil pressure sensor had failed and then started leaking. I have talked to several Sante Fe owners since then, and they had already experienced the same problem. I am now concerned that damage has been done to the motor, even though I watched and never saw the temperature gauge go up. Dealers have been notified that this problem exists, but owners are not notified of this COMMON problem."
2013,Hyundai,"Hyundai Builds a Warm Hatch. While the Elantra sedan is a very good compact, it's not particularly sporty.  The GTis the performance model, hot-hatch style. Hyundai has also added its Driver Selectable Steering Mode, which lets you choose between three settings that vary power assistance levels, on-center feel, and feedback in turns."
2014,Hyundai,"A reliable, inexpensive, reasonably fun coupe - not a sports car at all, but otherwise a solid car! The exterior is the real selling point of this car - it is definitely a looker, and in my opinion the 07-08 FL/2 body style is the strongest design of the GK models from 2003 on, before the car was discontinued. The GT wheels, dual exhausts, revamped headlights and taillights, etc. all look great and flow very well. The car attracted a lot of attention, and I would get questions about it constantly since they aren't especially common, at least around here."
2014,Hyundai,"The 2014 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T is a rolling rationalization for image-conscious consumers reluctantly shopping for a midsize sedan. It is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter I-4 that's supposed to provide the power of a V-6 but with better fuel economy. However,  is not the most rewarding car to drive in its class, nor is it the quickest."
2015,Hyundai,"2015 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.4: The seats have a beautiful leather, and are heated front & rear, and cooled in front.
The instruments are well laid out, simple to use, intuitive and have good quality buttons that feel pleasant to the touch.The interior has enough legroom in front for drivers under 6' tall. The roof is quite low, and anyone over 6'1"" will have his head hitting the roof handle. Good legroom in the rear, and it's easy entry. "
2015,Hyundai,"The competent 2015 Sonata 2.4 isn't a dynamically class-leading package, but at least it's not saddled with the expectations that come with the 245-hp 2.0T model's available Sport trim"
2016,Hyundai,"Hyundai XG350: Very reliable up to ~130k miles, then started to fall apart. It was my first car and I got it very cheaply so I am very happy with it overall. Airbag light came on ~100k miles and stayed on since then.
Interior is luxurious and spacious, but a bit behind its time. I think they tried to copy Lexus / Infiniti from late 90s. Factory speakers are great. A modern bluetooth capable system is an excellent and cheap (<$100) upgrade that makes the sound equivalent to modern cars. Drivetrain is very reliable and could probably run for another 100k miles easily.
Fairly cheap to maintain (regular grade gas and oil) until components need replacing. There are not many third party parts available for this car and the OEM parts are very expensive.
Ride quality is very boaty, with vague steering, soft suspension, and WIDE turning radius. Power is sufficient for good acceleration."
2016,Hyundai,"Enter the 2016 Hyundai Elantra Value Edition that offers just enough to give the model a more upscale feel, but the driving characteristics leave us wanting more."
2017,Hyundai,"2017 Hyundai Elantra GLS: Only beware of dramatic drop in price - Depreciation - Even Hyundai doesn’t want your car if you decide to change cars!
They are as expensive as Honda/Toyota... only when they’re new. Once you drive it off the lot, it will depreciate like no other car & good luck trading it in!
I learned the hard way that buying these cars means the most significant depreciation on the market as opposed to Honda/Toyota (that’s who they compete against the most!)...
My 2 cents... Otherwise I liked the car."
2017,Hyundai,Hyundai Elantra : A Fun Little Gem Hiding in Plain Sight. The 2017 Elantra Sport aims to put Hyundai in the sporty compact car conversation with a dose of turbocharged power and a totally overhauled suspension.
2018,Hyundai,"2018 Hyundai Elantra SEL 2.0L : Overall, I'm very impressed and satisfied with my new Elantra. It's a beautiful car inside and out. It feels solidly built and the interior fit and finish are top-notch for this class of car. I've heard professional auto critics say it feels ""a class above"". To me, it feels like a small luxury car. The looks, the comfort, the refinement, the features. It's all there to me. Plus, I've averaged just above 40 MPG in mostly city driving, according to the trip computer. Fantastic!
The car is too new to comment on reliability or running costs, but based on online consumer reviews and maintenance intervals in the owner's manual, I expect it will hold up well over time and be very affordable to run."
2018,Hyundai,"New for the 2018 model year, the Hyundai Elantra GT joins the growing compact hatchback segment and is pitched as a crossover alternative that's more fun to drive. Like most Hyundais, the Elantra GT is packed with plenty of tech features to keep you connected on the road."
2019,Hyundai,"Hyundai Santa Fe Sport Premium : Very well screwed together and very quiet. It has a lot of standard features like heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, heated front and rear seats, rear vents for HVAC, nice tinting on the windows with integrated sunshades for the rear seats. Headlamp performance is excellent (projector halogen). It's very easy to do routine maintenance like changing bulbs, cabin air filter and the engine air filter, etc. Fuel economy is pretty much the same as my old car, but they are not in the same category or decade, so it's not a fair comparison. Engine is quiet and performs nicely. I have no complaints about engine performance. I can't believe the high quality Hyundai has today. I'm confident I have chosen the right car for our family."
2009,GMC,GMC Yukon 2 : Big technology in a Big SUV may not be enough
2009,GMC,"GMC Yukon Denali XL 5.7 V8:  When we got this one, we were very, very pleased with the purchase. It's a bit cheaper in price than the similarly equipped Escalade.  We really love the fact that it's very roomy and the seats are couch like comfy. Even our kids love it, too. It's great in the snow, and perfect for family pleasure trips. And it's powerful, too! We have no plans on getting rid of it anytime soon. So if you are thinking about buying one of these, but don't want want to pay the price of what a similarly equipped Escalade charges, look no further."
2010,GMC,"GMC Yukon 6.0 :  Just had an oxygen sensor go out in the back. I would strongly recommend this to anyone, as there is no comparison in ride. We love traveling in it, and kids are comfortable and relaxed as they are watching their DVD. Changed oil every 3,500, and still running strong at 168000. I use it to pull my boat, which is around 4,500 lbs, and pulled it through mountains in TN and NC with no problem. I love it, and will buy another one when the time comes."
2010,GMC,GMC Yukon XL 5.3 : I like my Yukon. I would love to get a newer one. The truck always starts and runs great for me. It is a comfortable truck. The truck has lots of power for every thing I have pulled with it.
2011,GMC,"We tested a 2011 GMC Savana 3500, a vehicle that is mechanically identical to the 2012 model, and, because it's the 3500-series, we had the chance to try out the optional Duramax diesel. There is still plenty of capability here after all these years: it can tow 10,000 pounds, has a payload capacity of 4187 pounds, and has a 9600-pound Gross Vehicle Weight Rating.       The interior is pretty sparse, as you would expect in a cargo van, but considering its $44,620 as-tested price tag, we would've expected more equipment for the money. It did come with power locks (but there was no key fob control of them) and windows, tilt wheel and cruise control, glass on the passenger side and on the rear cargo doors, disc brakes, heavy-duty tow option, and a locking rear diff. However, there are no tie-down hooks on the cargo floor -- the van has a spacious 284.4-cubic-foot cargo volume, but no way to secure goods to the floor. There aren't power mirrors or a glove box, and that price doesn't include fancy leather seats."
2011,GMC,"GMC 1/2 Ton 5.7: The truck has lots of power, and good towing capacity. I travel a lot for work, and the truck handles great on the highway. The interior is roomy and relaxing to travel in, the truck has great heat for the cold times, but it blows warm air all the time.
Besides the little stuff, the truck is not nickel and dimeing me to death, and I have got my money's worth out of this truck, and would gladly pass it on for someone else to enjoy when I am ready for a new one."
2012,GMC,"GMC Jimmy 4.3 litre: VERY reliable vehicle. 4x4 works amazing!! I use it on wheeling trails all the time in deep snowfall too. Drives easy in about 2-3 feet of soft powder snow.
Great interior - still no rips at all. Good gas mileage - has very great power, and is the most reliable truck I've ever had. I am very happy with this truck!"
2012,GMC,"GMC Jimmy Sierra Classic 5.7 liter : I got a really straight body with no wrinkles, dings, dents, or scrapes. Really solid. The engine is a replacement with only 3,000 miles on it, and it is super strong! Transmission works impeccably, with no leaks. No cracks, spots, or dings in any of the glass. The rear glass does not roll all the way down, so the back door does not open. I think it's a really minor problem.The interior has been very well taken care of. Not but one little tear in the driver's seat, and it has been hand-sewn shut. The blue carpet has faded into grey, except where the original floor mats have covered it, and it is royal blue underneath. The four-wheel drive is tight, and the transfer case has no leaks around it anyplace. Need to be careful, as with any high ground clearance, but it doesn't feel unsafe."
2013,GMC,"GMC 1/2 Ton 6.0 : I can't repair a motor that was never supposed to work. They no longer make it and parts are not available... even thru the dealer. The 6.0 Vortec max was junk from the get go, and I cannot even find one used. This is what I bought? What am I to do... I use it for work, and for now I'm walking."
2013,GMC,"GMC 1/2 Ton 6.0: I can't repair a motor that was never supposed to work. They no longer make it and parts are not available... even thru the dealer. The 6.0 Vortec max was junk from the get go, and I cannot even find one used. This is what I bought? What am I to do... I use it for work, and for now I'm walking."
2014,GMC,"GMC Yukon Denali 6.0L: Beautiful truck with power and speed, let down by some very serious quality issues. I do love the looks, ride, and power that the GMC delivers, but not at the price of frequent dealership visits.I will miss this car, but my wallet will not. The last owner sold it at a good price and I was forced to do the same just to get rid of it."
2014,GMC,"I am not a fan of GM vehicles and never have been. However, the Yukon has been a great vehicle. Most of the issues that we have had with it have been of the normal wear and tear variety. Plenty of power, the AWD is great in the snow and ice, tires last a long time, and it's comfortable. Basic maintenance items (fluids, brakes, filters, lights) are very easy to get to. Rear seats are reasonably easy to fold down and/or remove."
2015,GMC,"The 2015 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL are refined and economical than ever, while retaining the utility they've become known for."
2015,GMC,"GMC Envoy SLT 4.2L l6: Interior is falling apart (center console lid was never correctly put on, driver's seat control panel is falling off, and radio labels are peeling off). Rear hatch window is rusted, will not stay open. Can be replaced easily, but not really worth it. Under body is very rusty (this is due to the salt, being in a northern state, so not really controllable). Rear speakers have shorted out (common problem for 2003 Envoys, GM needs to recall this). In the cold weather, the car has had a cylinder misfire ($500 repair)."
2016,GMC,"2016 GMC Terrain Denali: More style, luxury, and features for top model. The updates to the 2016 GMC Terrain are largely focused on cosmetics and more technological options, and we got a well-equipped Denali model in for testing."
2016,GMC,"It's a great, reliable car that I feel safe driving. Mine needs body work because I've got that Chevy rust thing going on along the bottom and rear quarter panels. It's my fault it's so rusty because I wasn't diligent with washing it more often and waxing especially because of the road salt/NJ winters. It's very comfortable to drive and it's so reliable. The car has a lot of integrity and it still pulls my extremely heavy all steel horse trailer with my 2 huge horses with no problems.
I'm shocked that Landcruiser got first place on this site. I had one before my Yukon XL and I love my Yukon much more. Landcruiser towed the horse trailer horribly even with modified (Tambren) suspension and a weight distribution system. You can't tell you're pulling the trailer in the Yukon. With the Landcruiser it was such a strain I actually felt like I was going to blow the engine towing with the Landcruiser. The Landcruiser was a much stiffer ride than the Yukon and the Yukon is much more luxurious feeling all around, from seats to steering to suspension and pick up speed."
2017,GMC,The 2017 GMC Acadia rides on a 112.5-inch-long wheelbase and is 193.6 inches long overall.The Acadia's sizable weight savings was also made possible through use of more high-strength steel throughout the platform. Crash safety has improved thanks to new splayed front frame rails that flare outward during small overlap frontal crashes.
2017,GMC,"2017 GMC Acadia : All in all, GMC has met its target of creating a smaller, more nimble, more refined, and softer-looking crossover with the 2017 Acadia. There is no reason to think this model won't outsell its larger predecessor."
2018,GMC,"Key upgrade is the 2018 Yukon Denali becomes one of the first SUVs in the GM stable to get the new 10-speed automatic transmission paired to its 6.2-liter V-8 engine that produces 420 hp and 460 lb.-ft. of torque to propel a vehicle weighing almost 6,000 pounds. Lower trim levels have the 5.3-liter V-8 with a six-speed transmission. The previous Yukon Denali with the 6.2-liter engine had an eight-speed."
2018,GMC,"GMC has never positioned the Terrain as a major volume player, instead preferring to compete in the premium category. Although not a top-seller, the Terrain doesn't hide in the background, at least not this time around. The 2018 GMC Terrain differentiates itself from others with atypical styling, an available diesel engine, and a wide range of model personalities and prices. The Terrain is a fish out of water in the compact crossover segment. But at the end of the day, only its merits will make the difference. We left the Terrain feeling satisfied, though further tests will shed more light on its strengths and weaknesses."
2019,GMC,"One look at the 2019 GMC Yukon Graphite Performance Edition, and you'll immediately notice its imposing presence. Even blacked out, it's hard to miss this hulking boulevardier thanks to its size and commanding looks. With a new generation of General Motors' full-size, body-on-frame SUVs on the way, we're taking one last look at the GMC Yukon to see whether it remains competitive against its key competitors."
2009,Ford,"Ford Fiesta Zectec : Never had a car with low profile tires and lowered suspension before, and the first few days of having it I thought that something was wrong, as it felt very rough on some roads, but talking to friends they said it's normal, and it's just the bad roads in Cornwall. Take it on a proper tarmac road and the handling is better than my brother's Golf GTI. Never once has it under or over steered or got out of shape, but I backed off as I was to chicken to push it any harder LOL. Acceleration is good, but it really kicks in in 3rd gear at about 4000 revs, where you feel the car just surge forward. Brakes are perfect; went onto a quite road and did an emergency stop to see if I could feel the ABS working, not a thing!!! The car didn't even skid and I never felt the ABS working, but I knew it was as the light came on the dashboard. The interior is good, really comfortable with the racing seats, and the stereo/phone controls are all voice activated, so no need for looking across at buttons. The speakers in the car are very good; my last car I fully kitted out with subs and speakers with the intention of doing the same to the fiesta. There is no need unless you want to spend £1000 on your sound system; don't bother because you won't beat the quality you already have."
2009,Ford,Ford Fusion SEL: It feels like a 4 door Mustang for driving. I wish there was a manual transmission for the V6. Microsoft Sync is great. I want to always have this in my vehicles. It will definitely influence my future purchases.
2010,Ford,"Ford Escape XLT 2.5: Well equipped SUV for the price, and optional Microsoft based SYNC system was great. Heated leather seats, sunroof, keyless entry, alloy wheels etc, though to me as a European, it made no sense whatsoever to have all that expensive kit on it and put brake drums on the rear. I haven't seen a new car with brake drums in Europe for 15-20 years, yet here in N. America they're still used. WHY??? Luckily for me, the Escape was a company vehicle so repairs didn't cost be a bean, but I would have been extremely unhappy to have to replace the worn out tie bars & anti sway bars etc after such a short distance, and Ford refused to cover them under warranty."
2010,Ford,"Ford Escape XLT: The ride is a bit more bumpy than my Pontiac, but that's expected given it's an SUV.Transmission is very short in 1st and 2nd gear. I'll be in 3rd by the time I hit 25mph. Normal for a truck or SUV though.Engine is said to be noisy... compared to a sedan or high end SUV, yes it is. But compared to other trucks or SUVs, it's no different. Doesn't bother me at all.Acceleration is quick with the V6 and 240hp.Radio does seem to have problems maintaining reception when going under bridges or into a valley. It comes back after a few seconds though.Seats are comfortable and the interior is roomy.Interior materials are not high quality, even a little below average quality, but not the worst I've seen.
Rear seats are NOT difficult to fold down. It's 3 motions; take out head rest, lift base of seat, fold the backrest down. That's it. Don't let comments that it's complicated fool you.
The 4x4 feature is intelligent, meaning you can't activate it. It will kick in if the front wheels slip."
2011,Ford,"Ford Escape Limited : This was a rental car for about 3 weeks.Roomy interior, seats are comfortable.Excellent engine power (and noise), the transmission works excellent and the car is surprisingly quick and fun to accelerate. Very good driving position and visibility. Handles fine with somehow a European feeling, impressive for a car this size. The steering is slow to turn. Good brakes. Very bumpy ride over potholes. Otherwise the ride is very smooth and comfortable."
2011,Ford," Ford Fiesta Titanium: Compared to my previous car (a '99 Vauxhall Corsa), this car is a dream to drive. The 1.6 petrol engine is very nippy, especially around 4000 rpm. My average MPG has been around 45, which I believe isn't too bad for a 1.6 petrol engine. The interior has a very modern design, and the comfort is second to none for someone of average height like myself (5'10""). The stereo system is of greater than average quality, and sounds great with a few equaliser adjustments. There is a slightly louder than normal tyre noise when travelling at speed, but around 30 you can barely hear anything."
2012,Ford,"Ford Fusion SEL Flex Fuel : Overall, this car is a great car, that really surprised me at how well it did on fuel economy and ride. The ride is fairly smooth and well controlled. The trunk is big, and the interior cabin room is good."
2012,Ford,"Ford Fiesta SE Sedan: The new Ford Fiesta is a beautiful car. It has the new Microsoft Sync built-in, so that you can connect your phone with Bluetooth to receive and make calls. The system is able to dial numbers with your phone through voice activation. There is also a number pad on the dash that can be used to dial numbers as well. I am averaging about 28.7 MPG in the city where I live, but Ford says it can get up to about 39 on the highway. They also told me that some people have reported averaging around 43 MPG, but it is dependent on how you drive. The seats are very comfortable, and the interior is surprisingly spacious for such a small car. From the outside, the trunk also looks very small, but when it is open, you can see that the trunk is actually very deep and spacious as well.The car is slightly jerky when I push on the gas sometimes (not often), but I attribute this to still not being fully accustomed to the new engine compared to my old car (which had transmission slip).The dashboard and steering wheel are accented with red lighting (may or may not vary with other Fiestas) that looks very sharp.

"
2013,Ford,"Ford Fiesta SE : Took it in for trans. issues at 700 miles. Was told it was normal to bang, slip and smell until it's broken in at 1k miles. Now they say it needs a new clutch and there are none to be had anywhere on a waiting list. Don't stop on a hill, because when you try to take off, the RPM goes up, but you roll backwards! My daughter's first new car, and needless to say it will probably be her last Ford!"
2013,Ford,"For those looking to get acquainted with Ford's big sedan, 2013 is the first year of the sixth-gen's mid-cycle refresh. A lot changed after three years. To help mitigate the interior volume concerns, the cabin is decked out with nicer materials; a substantially less cluttered center stack; three-spoke steering wheel; and an eye-catching gauge cluster with crisp, configurable digital screens"
2014,Ford,"Ford Escape XLT 4 : The Ford Escape is a superior product, in my view, to our former vehicle, which burdened us relentlessly with intense frustration and far too many warranty repairs on chronic transmission defects: gears, shifts, gearbox, clutch and manual transmission and more.The Escape is highly reliable, strong, stylish, and its model label ""Escape"" delivers - you can escape the concrete jungle to take it anywhere in confidence and reliability. You can use this vehicle for a variety of purposes, and we love the better glass visibility and height all around compared to the poor visibility in a lower framed car, the Patriot. The Escape will always be a favorite SUV in my family, and in particular, ours allowed us to ""escape"" the outrageous chronic problems of our former substandard nightmare, the 2008 Jeep Patriot. I regret not buying a Ford when we bought the Jeep. Ford respects its customers... no comment about the other company, but you can read between the lines."
2014,Ford,You get a gem of an engine with the Ford Fiesta SFE EcoBoost. The rest of the car isn't bad either.
2015,Ford,"Great SUV if you don't need something too big, but like the ""utility"" of a sport utility. It handles and accelerates nicely, and is even a bit fun to drive.
The interior seems to be well made, with no squeaks or rattles. The only thing I would change is something many other newer cars are just as guilty of: hard plastic surfaces instead of padded. It's the only thing about the vehicle that makes it seem cheap.
Other than that, it's wonderfully styled, inside and out. It seems to have a lot of nice features for a car in its class, as well."
2015,Ford,"Ford has entered a quick growing segment in the cargo/passenger van/wagon market and has done it the right way. It offers a massive variety of configurations to fit any need its customers might have, from a comfort-friendly passenger vehicle to heavy-duty work vehicle and everything in between. What Ford has done with the 2015 Transit will not go unnoticed by its competition, and for very good reason."
2016,Ford,"Ford Escape XLT 3.0: It's been a great little SUV. It's just the right size, and gets decent MPG. It drives nicely and even feels a little sporty. The stereo (mine has a factory subwoofer) isn't bad. It's the only factory stereo I haven't upgraded in a vehicle I've owned. Lots of storage in the center console, and comfortable on longer trips, too.
Could use some rear legroom, though. And the cloth seats stain easily if they get wet, even with just water. A carpet cleaner with an upholstery attachment works great to solve that. So do cheap seat covers.
I don't have any major complaints, and have only had to do routine maintenance to it."
2016,Ford,"Had owned a '05 Ford Escape XLT with 4WD in upstate NY for 220k miles over 8 years. Only issues were the front brake rotors would warp every 60k - 75k miles and the alternator died at 175k miles and the A/C died at 200k miles. Also, tin worm was coming to the surface due to heavy use of road salt in NY. Based on the above experience and since 2012 was last year for the six cylinder engine, I bought a used '12 Escape Limited V6 front wheel drive with 30k miles. The car is comfortable, and quieter than my older Escape. Also, fuel economy is 24 to 25 MPG versus 21 MPG on the '05 4WD model. However, I find the new car is less fun to drive. The old Escape had feedback via the steering wheel whereas the steering on the new car is numb and void. The new car rides so smoothly compared to the old car that I feel isolated from the road. The new car has morphed into mini LTD whereas the old Escape was a true mud slinging CUV."
2017,Ford,"Ford Explorer Base: Just way too big. We got the car for my wife. She is happy with it, but finds it cumbersome to drive. I cannot drive it because the interior is too big for me to comfortably rest my arm on the door sill or arm rests. Arm fatigue sets in for me after only a few miles. Very poor design for driving comfort. The build quality is great, as it is with all Ford products. Fit and finish are top-notch. The interior is well appointed and controls are conveniently located. The third row seat are useless and waste space needlessly. They should be an option, not standard. We didn't want them. The engine is smooth, quiet and responsive. Power is adequate. The automatic transmission shifts very smoothly. Fuel economy is awful. We are averaging only 19 miles per gallon. The handling is good for a big bulky and top-heavy vehicle. Overall the car is excellent for my wife. I greatly preferred our smaller Ford Escape turbo, but for an older woman who doesn't care for sporty performance, the Explorer is a good choice. As always we test drove other brands for a comparison, but as always nothing else comes close to Ford in overall quality."
2017,Ford,"Ford Explorer Base: The engine has an internal water pump and people on the Explorer forum have had them go out. This is a very expensive repair due to the labor involved. If you keep your Explorer for a long time, it would be a good idea to extend the warranty. 2000 dollars for a water pump replacement is too much. Also if it takes out the engine, it goes up to almost 8 grand. Keep us updated as time and mileage accumulate."
2018,Ford,Ford Escape XLT 3.0: Really like it and would buy another in a second if Ford still offered it with the V6. The gas mileage is great - regularly gets 36 MPG (Imperial) 30 MPG (US) on the highway. Reliability has been fantastic.
2018,Ford,"2018 Ford Expedition Max: Maximizing comfort, tech, safety, and of course, room. The redesigned 2018 Ford Expedition has impressed us in many ways. In a five-way full-size SUV comparison, the Expedition walked away with the victory. ""Spacious, smart, comfortable, quick, and efficient, the Expedition does it all well,"" we concluded. ""On-road, off-road, towing, you name it—this is the best in class."""
2019,Ford,"2019 Ford Ecosport: Short of eco and sport. Sync user interface, well-appointed interior on SES model. But It's poor on gas, noisy, and ugly. "
2009,Audi,"The all wheel drive is amazing. Even though there is no snow down here in Florida, it is a wonderful feature to have with all the slick wet roads down here from the summer monsoon rains. Rain doesnt even affect the handling. I don't think I've ever spun the tires since ive had it, no matter how hard i try, even in wet conditions. The ride is smooth and it almost even seems to steer itself through the curves. It has a lot of pep and is pretty quick, however, you arent going to beat most cars in a striaght line drag race. Save your money and buy a mustang or camaro if that's what you want. This car was built for comfort and handling. Not straight line speed. The car is very easy on the eyes and the interor is just as refined. The seats are genuine leather. Not that leatherette stuff you see in certain lower level luxury cars (cough acura cough cough). Only con is the car burns oil. It doesnt create any white smoke though. The oil just seems to disappear. I am told by Audi this is because the oil also helps cool the hot turbo charger and is then run through an oil cooler. The oil then seems to evaporate before it finds its way back into the case. Aside from having to spend an extra couple bucks on oil (which is the super duty full synteic Euro formual $10 per quart) the performance of the car does not seem to be affected. Just keep an eye on your oil light!! The all wheel drive is also hard on tires and the weight of the car coupled with it's performans is also hard on brake pads. I've already had to replace the tires and brakes at 25,000 miles. All in all, it's worth it!!"
2010,Audi,"I have had this car since delivered to me directly ordered from the factory. The car has elegance wrapped in an excellent sporty exterior. The car I have has the sport package so the suspension is a little stiffer but not overly uncomfortable even on the roughest of roads. It has handled everything from the German autobahn to the interstates from the port in Maryland and across the United States. The 2.0T engine delivers power although the turbo does not seem to pick it up until around 2900 RPM. The car is a comfortable ride whether just across town or heading in the Rockies hours away. The car has not had any issues other than it just developed a small vacuum leak on the exhaust that was easily found and fixed. The other item is the voice-to-navigation translation does not pick up well, have to dial in 7 out of 10 addresses which is tedious. Gas mileage matches the rated mileage as shown on the original sticker although mine is driven more in city type driving than highway. Out on the open winding roads the car is a dream to drive. It sticks to the pavement at all ranges available (did take it on some German roads up to the 130 mph speed limiter limit and road like driving 65 mph). Ride is firm but smooth. I would buy another one of these or another Audi for my next or even second car."
2011,Audi,"Too bad Audi has stopped making this model, wanting us to upgrade to the AllRoad (a little clumsy looking) or the SUV (a hulk). I've always owned wagons and this was far the best yet. It's handling is superb. The combo of nimble 4-cyl. turbocharged 211-hp engine and 8-speed Tiptronic transmission gets excellent gas mileage yet offers all the power anybody could want. Acceleration at all speeds is quick, powerful, and deeply satisfying. This powertrain, as many have reported, is a work of genius, better than a BMW's in this range. As more car companies downsize to four-cylinder engines, this is the standard they'll want to beat. But they won't."
2012,Audi,"Owning an Audi A4 is like a status symbol for some, however for me its a feeling of ecstasy and achievement every time I step into it. Its a wonderful car made for those who believes in driving something that adapts to their own style of driving. Such a car is an Audi A4 which gives you the freedom to drive according to the condition. Very reliable and accurate dynamics for every season, anywhere in world. All I can say is that people who have driven Audi can only tell you how precise is the handling and maneuvering of this car that gives an ultimate joy of driving !!"
2013,Audi,"The car is fun to drive. The maintenance costs are to ridiculous. The car constantly burns oil which the maintenance service contract does not cover. And you have to change the brakes and rotors at 30k. My lease was for 35,000 miles. When I refused to change the brakes and rotors, they told me I will be dinged for it when I return the vehicle. Basically they want me to pay $800+ to drive 5k more. I have never been in a car that needs to change the brakes at 30k. And all I do are leases. Cars pretty but constantly spending on synthetic oil to top off every 1k to 1.5k miles. I had to buy 4 new set of tires at 20k. But I average about 28 mpg. All this does not add up."
2014,Audi,"I consider myself a 'car guy'. My drive to work is 97 miles one way. Thankfully, I no longer have to do this on a daily basis. But it does mean that I consider my automobile purchases very, very carefully. I've been a student at several high performance driving schools and have owned 2 240Z's and still own an Acura NSX. The Audi A4 Premium Plus is an incredibly satisfying automobile. I've owned it for a year and have driven it over 25K miles. I still make excuses to just get in it and drive. I absolutely love driving it!!! Handling is sublime, acceleration while not staggering, will still push you back in the seat. Gas mileage is very good at just above 25 mpg (and I don't drive slowly). Reliability has been excellent though I am aware of using top tier fuel to avoid carbon buildup on the valves given the direct injection and turbocharged components of the engine. I use a fuel system treatment designed to remove this buildup as I've learned that it may become a problem as mileage increases. Build quality is excellent. Features are impressive and both convenient and useful. And frankly, it gets a lot of positive attention ;0) I LOVE THIS CAR! Perhaps the best all around car I've ever owned!"
2015,Audi,"Great luxury sedan value. I compared this vehicle to the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-class. All had their advantages. I liked the BMW styling the best, the Mercedes had a fantastic interior but the Audi did well in all categories. What finally sold me was the value. For several thousand less, I was able to get a sun roof, NAV, and heated leather seats. Other standard features were options on the other two cars. The ride in the Audi A4 is very luxurious and it sticks to the road in any weather conditions. It is an absolute pleasure to drive and I look forward to any trip. I haven't owned it long enough to comment on reliability or cost of ownership but I did get the maintenance package ($800) which pays for the first four major checkups--good deal. Love this car."
2016,Audi,"I enjoy driving again. This car has turned around my views on driving. It is a pleasure again. The car is the ultimate blend of comfort, performance and control."
2017,Audi,"Bought this 17 A4 4/16 and absolutely love it. As the 24k in 9 months can attest i drive a lot of highway miles. At highway speeds this thing is so quite it gives you the false impression that you are not going as fast as you are. Several times in the first few months i looked down and saw i was pushing 90+ mph and quickly slowed down. I did find there is a way to set a warning when you pass a certain speed and it will alert you. On curvy roads it is even better as it takes just about anything you can throw at it with predictability, and youd have to do something pretty stupid to get this thing sideways as it tracks right where you point it and the quattro gives unbelievable grip. Fit and finish are top notch and even after all these miles i still grin as i head toward this car for a long drive and fire up the virtual cockpit for my next adventure. Although decidedly skewed towards highway miles my lifetime mpg is 33 mpg which is 2 greater than stated on the Monroney sticker. Added together, the quality feel, smooth quiet ride, good fuel economy, sporty 5.7 seconds to 60 and sticky handling there is simply no way to go wrong"
2018,Audi,"Ive been driving Audis since 2005. Somehow the older cars feel more solid and better than the new one. I understand that with so many gadgets the car can have some misses, but the basic Apple Carplay that should connect your iPhone to the MMI simply does not work. My car is about 3 weeks old and this happens. I contact the AudiUSA for support and after a couple of weeks worth of the usual, can you use other usb cable, try another usb port, is your phone updated, or try another phone... The final verdict is that I MUST take my car to a dealers..."
2019,Audi,"This is my second A4, I traded in my 2017 lease for a new 2019 this year with a few extra features. Overall, the car has a really nice interior, strong engine, nice tech features and sound system, comfortable seating, and decent handling. I am so very sorry, however, that I leased a car from Audi in 2019, however. Just days after taking this car home I called the dealer to bring it in for service. The car seems to drift on concrete roadways, which is very unnerving. I live in southern California, where many of the freeways and other main roadways are paved in concrete. For whatever reason, the 2019 vehicles just don't stay put on the road and tend to drift left or right. This does not inspire confidence in driving the car at higher speeds, and it tends to make me not want to drive the car other than for short drives. It's such a huge disappointment for a car that costs as much as it does. The dealer has not been able to address the issue and even Audi's customer service did not offer any resolution or even apology. This will be my last Audi purchase, unfortunately I am stuck with it now for the remainder of the lease."
2009,Bentley,"The vehicle has long stood for excess and opulence, and I knew that going in. I expected the Continental GT to be over-engineered and capable of high-speed thrills. And it is, but there’s more.

The tester I’m driving costs $279,000. Of course it’s beautiful and fast and dripping with technology. It’s a Bentley. Inside and out, at high speed or low speed, the latest Continental GT exceeded all my expectations.

The machine glides over the road, powered by a mechanical symphony performing under the hood. The W12 engine is a dying breed, and it’s a shame. It’s stunning in its performance. This is a 200 mph vehicle, but I didn’t hit those speeds. What surprised me the most is that I didn’t need to go fast. The new Continental GT is thrilling in a way that doesn’t require speed.

2010,Buick,"The interior of the LaCrosse is very cramped, and it's smaller than I'd expect for a Buick. I constantly hit my elbow on the center console and bump my head getting in. Besides the bad interior room, the seats are amazing. The seats are very comfortable and squishy. The LaCrosse also has good trunk space, you could fit 4 bodies in there if you arranged them right. The car's styling has aged well, and it stills looks nice and luxurious. It also has very Buick-like suspension. It feels like you're gliding on a magic carpet when you go over potholes. It's a great car besides the tiny interior space."

2012,Buick,"I've really enjoyed this car so far. It's so comfortable to travel in. I've really enjoyed the infotainment system, it's great if you're traveling long distances. The driver's seat is the most comfortable of any car I've ever owned. I recently took a trip with family and my sister, who usually gets car sick in the back seat, said that she didn't have any sickness in this car. I think that has to do with how well it rides. This car has the first back up camera I've ever had in a car, parallel parking is so much easier than other cars I've owned...."
2013,Buick,"With composed handling and top-quality interior materials, many automotive journalists agreed that the 2013 Buick Regal is an appealing sport sedan. Strong acceleration in Regal GS
Balanced handling
Top-shelf cabin materials
Limited rear-seat headroom
Small trunk in eAssist models"
2013,Buick,"I leased Infiniti's before shopping around this time. Wanted a smooth ride with luxurious interior. Test drove every luxury car out there for 6 months. Happened to stop into Buick because it was right next door to the Cadillac showroom. Drove the LaCrosse and was blown away. Leased it in October 2013 and couldn't be happier. It is pure luxury - smooth, smooth ride, comfortable and roomy seats plus so quiet, I have to check to make sure the car is on. Buick made a slam dunk with this car. Everyone that has been in the car have been so surprised that it is a Buick. People actually stop me in parking lots to comment on the car. I have the dark gray with very light gray (almost white) interior. Hope they bring that interior back again. It's just beautiful. One con I have is the interior colors for the 2014 are too dark. Especially the beige. It's awful."
2014,Buick,"The Buick Regal sits in the top third of the midsize car class thanks to its quality interior, solid reliability, composed handling, and turbocharged engine performance. That said, rear-seat headroom is rather slim for the class. Poised handling
Comfortable front seats
Punchy four-cylinder turbo
eAssist models have a small trunk and weak acceleration
So-so fuel economy"
2014,Buick,"I researched many models before deciding on the LaCrosse. I leased it for 39 months and the incentives made it very attractive. All in, with no downpayment except for my trade (only $800 equity) I pay $359 per month. The car is quiet and the ride is silky smooth. The seats are comfortable, plenty of room, tastefully done interior. It's a real luxury cruiser and doesn't try to be anything but that. This is no sports sedan so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. It's a little underpowered even with the 3.6L V6 because of its size. The steering is a little loose for my taste and nobody will mistake its handling for an M5. But if you like to ride around in style and comfort but can't afford or don't want to pay for a Caddy, Lincoln, Lexus or MB, give the LaCrosse a look and I'm sure you'll be tempted by the value."
2015,Buick,"The 2015 Buick Regal finishes in the middle of the midsize car class. It has an upscale and comfortable interior, impressive handling, and an above-average reliability rating. However, some rivals are roomier and more fuel-efficient. Above-average reliability rating

Rear seat is short on headroom
Awkwardly shaped trunk
Subpar fuel economy with base engine"
2015,Buick,"Bought this car new. I’m not a mechanical person so when I say this I hope you know what I’m saying. I’ve had this car for 4 years. I’ve had to replace something called a cam shaft, a pully on the engine, a belt to the engine, battery, a low compressor, multiple fuses, and still sometimes the radio and screen will just not work for 15-20 minutes. I’ve had to have the keys replaced 3 times already. To much for a car that’s 4 years old. Even though it has a lot of issues. This car still got me home safely. I was out of town, this car still got me home (15 hour drive) with a bad compressor and cam shaft. So if you get this car make sure you get an extended warranty. It’s has lots of room and comfortable ride. Interior material could be made of a better material."
2016,Buick,"The 2016 Buick Regal has a classy interior, useful technology, and sporty handling, but its high total cost of ownership pushes it toward the back of our midsize car rankings. Many upscale standard features

2016,Buick,"Bought a left over 2016 Sport. sharp, firm ride. Not into Tech but this is the right amount. Cool headlights that follow steering. Great infomat system and GPS- finds nearest gas and price of fuel at each. Bad blind spots- recommend blind spot warning if available. Trunk feels small and fills up quickly when going out with family. I do not like the quick depreciation but plan on keeping till they tow it away. Drives like a higher priced Luxury car. Dislike the keyless remote- left engine on numerous times but horn warns me when that happens. Remote Door unlock using handle- erratic to use."
2017,Buick,"Despite its athletic handling and upscale cabin, the 2017 Buick Regal has a weak engine lineup, tight passenger space, a small trunk, and high ownership costs. As a result, it ranks near the back of the midsize car class. Impressive interior materials
User-friendly touch screen
Agile handling
Less rear-seat space than rivals
Weak base engine
Lag with turbocharged engine"
2017,Buick,"This sedan is one of the quiestest inside. I wanted a quiet and smooth ride without getting a 7 Series BMW or a vehicle that looks like I am 80 years old to drive it. The options are luxurious and the car is a smooth ride. The design is slightly above average for a sedan and Buick lost its old people look. Quality should be noted in the tri-coat paint, headlight features, and the drivers area cockpit. Any area for improvement is the transmission. It is not always smooth and can be inconsistent in the exact same daily commute. I have owned a hybrid so I can be mindful of the pedal and work with it like you do with a hybrid to get the most economy."

2019,Buick,"The 2019 Buick Regal offers plenty of cargo space and a good predicted reliability rating, but it trails its rivals in nearly every other area, including cabin quality and cornering agility.

2019,Buick,"I had intended to buy the 6 cylinder 310 HP engine, but the deal I got on the 4 cylinder 194 HP was just too good to pass up. We figured that if we didn’t like the 4 cylinder we could resale without losing too much due to getting a really good deal. After 16,000 miles, going from Alabama to Key West, FL, to Texas, to North Dakota, to Washington, DC, etc over 4 months, we love this car! The 4 cylinder has plenty of acceleration. While my city driving is actually poor (compared to how good the highway miles are) at about 21 MPH, my highway miles (the reason I bought it as I drive 90% on the highway) are wonderful at 35 MPH typically, 41 MPG on flat highways (think Texas), and 31-35 MPH on rolling hills depending on the steepness. Worth noting that I’m not crawling along to get this great mileage. I drive 5 MPH over the speed limit on average and Texas and South Dakota have 80 MPH speed limits in rural areas. This is real miles and yet General Motors is discontinuing the Lacrosse! Go figure. This Lacrosse is the most comfortable and economical combination in my 50 years of driving, and I have traded vehicles frequently over those 50 years. The CUE entertainment system works well also. More intuitive than my 2016 6 cylinder Lacrosse and 2014 Cadillac SRX, and has Car Play. Car Play is great whatever vehicle you own or rent as it works from your cell phone and works with your car’s system, and is free. OnStar is a long way from free!"
2010,Cadillac,I purchased this vehicle in replacement of a Yukon Denali that was totaled in a recent accident. The Escalade is stylish and a definite eye catcher. The Escalade also helps me transport my big family and enough room for my physically handicap child to enjoy themselves.

Hybrid battery gone at 135K miles, Throttle body replaced at 71453K miles, and then again at 130368K miles. Catalytic converter around the same time. I would not go near American cars again. A Lexus owner has similar large SUV with over 250K miles with no similar major problems to date"

2011,Cadillac,II love Cadillac and their service is amazing. I feel so happy when I go into my local dealership knowing I'm completely taken care of. love my Escalade. It's my 3rd Cadillac and my 2nd Escalade. I've been very satisfied with all of my Cadillac vehicles except that they unfortunately don't keep their value. This is a huge issue for me and honestly may keep me from investing in another Cadillac. As much as I love the vehicle I'm leaning more towards the Lexus luxury SUV that keeps it's value much better long term.

2012,Cadillac,"Great driving vehicle, with enough guts to get you off to a quick start, braking is ok considering the weight of the vehicle. Drives like a dream, quite, and smooth. Very comfortable. Downside which has been corrected in their 2015 model is the removal of the 3rd. row back seats. They are heavy, and a pain to get in and out.

Virtually same car for significantly less cost. After 3 years it has lost 50% of it's market value. If money is not an issue it's a good selection. Cadillac just doesn't have the reputation or image it used to have. Now, would someone please convince my wife of that."
2016,Cadillac,"The 2016 Cadillac CTS has potent available engines and nimble handling. It's luxurious, too, with high-end materials lining the cabin.

The look is imposing and modern, the cabin is SUPER QUIET and the ride with Magnetic Ride Control is EXCELLENT. The fit and finish is first rate, the cabin technology is cutting edge.

Man this car have put me through so much in just the last couple (mo). I have put a new water pump, radiator, thermostat and more. And guess what. The heat still don't work and it's 12/31/2016. So yes. It's cold out and just yesterday the thing stop starting up for what I don't know. So I go get a new battery and spark plug for it yesterday and that still didn't work. So I couldn't make it to work. So now I don't have a job. Wow. THANKS Chrysler. What a happy new year. Oh and I forgot say that because of the PT I was late for my wedding cause of this car. I really feel like Chrysler owe me. This car has put me through so much hell I don't even want another car and I know other people that have a PT and going through the same. So I know they know that this car needs to be recalled. We don't have money like they do and this car has put me so far in the hold. I don't know what to even say and then like everyone has been saying it's not like they make the car to where it can be work on easy. So now I'm out of a car, out of money and out of a job all because of a PT CRUISER. Well to my new found family you all have a good new year and let's go to foreign cars (LOL). Be safe everyone."

But also followed the maintenance guidelines. They are comfortable, quiet, and roomy. Has the most room inside of any of the mini vans. When the seats are removed or stashed, you can fit a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood in the back. Average gas mileage 22-24 mpg. Love these vehicles."

My car has been to Outten Chrysler in PA 4 times for the same transmission issues. They even claimed to have given me a new transmission. But I think this is a lie. I am going to have the vin # checked on the so called new garbage transmission. Outten Chrysler even seems like they would rather avoid me than to fix the problem. Doing some useless computer update (3 times already) that fails every time. I am not the only one. There are many complaints like mine for the same van and same issue. RIP-OFF.

2016,Dodge,I have a 2006 Dodge 2500 Ram. I was driving to the store when I smelled smoke coming from under my seat and the cab filled up with smoke. I pulled over and got my two grandkids out of the truck and flagged someone down a man throw water on it and got the fire out. Chrysler sent out a recall person to check it out and I received a letter stating their investigation concluded it wasn't their fault. I tried to call and find out how they came up with the reason an original part would catch on fire but got no call back from them. I am not happy that this is how they conduct their business. Very scary. Me and my grandkids could have burned up in my truck.
2017,Dodge,
2018,Dodge,"I bought a used 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 from an independent car dealer. I had it checked out at the time of purchase and all seemed to be fine, but nonetheless I purchased an extended warranty just in case. Four months later the engine developed a tick. I did some researching to find that the 5.7 Hemi has a tick at start up but goes away shortly after it warms up. My tick did not go away. More and more research revealed that hundreds of people have had problems with the exhaust manifold bolts breaking due to the inferior grade of bolts that Dodge used to secure the header to the exhaust manifold. Whether it's the rapid heat build up or aluminum manifold that heats and cools too quickly I am not sure, but it is definitely a problem and Dodge knows it. It can happen on either the driver's side or passenger's side of the engine. And unless you replace all the bolts with stainless steel manifold bolts, you are just asking to have to do this over again in the future. Despite the fact they know they screwed up and this is going to cost their customers hundreds of dollars to fix, they have not issued a recall. They know they screwed up because you go to any Dodge dealer and they have a full set of stainless steel manifold bolts on hand just in case. Why would they keep these upgraded manifold bolts on hand if they didn't know this was a problem. This is why. Because they are avoiding a costly recall and passing the buck to their customers. I took mine to a Dodge dealer to have it diagnosed to make sure it wasn't an internal issue like valves or something, but had a good suspicion of exactly what the problem was after the many reviews and forums I had read online. Sure enough, after a $140 diagnosis charge, they told me it was the broken exhaust manifold bolts and the gasket had also failed as a result. I presented my extended warranty and they called, but alas!! They will not cover any of the repairs because it was not the exhaust manifold itself or the header that failed, but the sub-grade bolts Dodge used. Leaving me to foot the cost of an estimated $720-$950 repair. And that's just for two bolts because they have to drill into the bolts to extract them from the manifold. Thanks Dodge!! You suck!! They are dodging the bullet, or the recall. They know it is a problem and will only fix it if you are the original owner with the lifetime drivetrain warranty. Some extended warranties have covered it, but not mine. They also are getting a nasty review. They also know it's a problem and are finding loopholes not to cover the issue, again leaving the customer to foot the bill.As I read up on all these forums, posts, reviews, I see that this has occurred across many years of Ram 1500's. From 2004-2013. Maybe the newer ones just have not busted yet, who knows. One thing I can tell you is that I am one buying American vehicles. They are shysters and will not own up to their faults. I can see why people pay the higher price tag of Toyota. They build vehicles that last and when they find a fault, they fix it rather than pass the buck to their customers. My best advice, DO NOT BUY DODGE!"
2019,Dodge,"I bought a 2017 charger and while under warranty the infotainment screen started to malfunction. There was a fluid inside the screen that kept expanding. I contacted the dealership which in turn submitted a claim to get the screen repaired. The car was still under warranty (under 36,000 miles). Dodge refused the claim and the dealership wants to charge me 2,800 dollars for the repair. It was a big mistake getting a Dodge since they don’t honor their warranty."

2014,Fiat,
2015,Fiat,"The Fiat 500 is one of the most stylish and desirable city cars there is, so you’d imagine that the convertible version – the 500C – would crank that desirability up even more. Well, it does to a degree, because you’ll feel the wind in your hair as you drive along. However, because the folding top amounts to little more than a big sunroof and the overall dimensions of the car stay identical whether the roof is up or down, it doesn’t have the glamour – or the true open-top thrills – of other convertibles. That said, buyers still love its cute, retro looks. The round headlights and front indicators are a direct evolution of those from the 1957 original, as is the bonnet shutline, which runs along the front wing rather than hidden on an angle. There’s plenty of scope to create a unique 500C, too, with a huge range of options and accessories to choose from."
2016,Fiat,"Car is nice vibrant. Fiat always known for stability has been proved with this car. The age of the car has not hampered the speed and smoothness on the highways. Every drive is a new experience and the feeling of pride. The care of the wear and tear due to the use if taken care of the car can be the best vintage car after 16 years from now. My best car, my sweet heart who has always been with me and supported me for my punctuality. durable, stable, attractive and adorable. Hope i would be lucky to keep you with me always."
2017,Fiat,"Fiat doesn’t enjoy a particularly glowing reputation for reliability, and this is borne out by a second-from-last place position in the J.D. Power 2019 UK Vehicle Dependability Study. The Warranty Direct Reliability Index paints the brand in a more positive light, with the brand occupying in a respectable mid-table position."
2018,Fiat,"When I was reading about Fiat 500, the first thing I googled out is ?why should I buy this car?? The question is both obvious and relevant especially when we talk about Indian market conditions. No matter what the Fiat fans say, but this car, in my opinion, is certainly not for competitive Indian auto market. There are two main reasons for that; one is the radical styling and the second is the steep pricing, both do not match to the mindset of the people here. Even elite buyers would avoid this tiny car and go for some luxury vehicle in the Rs. 30 lakh price range. However, the external appearance of body decals and sporty alloy wheels will definitely turn the heads on the roads. The inside too is the epitome of sporty design with red-black stitching on the seats, the instrument cluster and the overall fit and finish of the cabin. The performance level of this car is nothing short of excellence. The Abarth prefix is enough to excite any performance oriented auto enthusiast. Powering this pocket rocket is the 1.4L turbocharged petrol engine that makes 160bhp and peak torque 230Nm, paired to 5-speed manual transmission. The car is able to break the 100kmph barrier in less than 8 seconds of time. Still, Fiat 500 is not everyone?s cup of tea. This is the vehicle for those who love to make a style statement along with jaw-dropping performance. Fiat 500 can also be an option for those who are thinking of buying Mini Cooper S. Other than these, there is no solid reason why this car should be called a mass market vehicle."

2014,Acura,"2014 Acura RLX: At the track, the Acura proved surprisingly fun to drive for a front-drive sedan, lacking heavy understeer in eight-tenths driving and giving generally neutral behavior. The brakes felt strong without being overassisted and grabby, but even in Sport mode the manual shifts via paddle were a little slow -- both up and down -- for track work. We predict fewer than 1 percent of RLXs built will ever set tire to track, and found the shift times adequate for road use for the other 99 percent of RLX drivers."
2015,Acura,"Acura has made things a bit simpler. Three engine options from the original model have since been reduced to just one, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 201 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque. And there's a single transmission, an eight-speed dual-clutch. The ILX seems more focused, which means either it will hit the target right on the mark or miss its opportunity completely."
2016,Acura,"My car is a 2016. I bought it used. It was in excellent condition. The acceleration is lacking somewhat. It has a hesitation problem. But it's a nice looking SUV. It's smaller than the car I sold when I bought this. That was a Hyundai Santa Fe. The Acura has some convenient things. It has a moon roof. It doesn't use a key to start the car. It's a push button. Mine has fully adjustable front heated seats. They are leather. I'd like to have cooled seat because I live in southern Arizona. Overall it's a good car that's a little hard on gas, however."
2017,Acura,"2017 Acura MDX: Acura keeps things simple by offering only two main flavors of MDX. The volume seller is powered by a 3.5-liter naturally aspirated, direct-injection V-6 that makes 290 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and 267 lb-ft of torque at 4,700 rpm. A ZF-sourced nine-speed transmission is the only transmission available in this MDX. In entry-level models, it routes power to the front wheels. Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, which sends power to all four wheels, is also available."
2018,Acura,"The Acura MDX Sport Hybrid has a lot going for it, but the crossover does lack in some areas. Even though the multimedia system is easy to use, the dual-screen interface looks aged as does the navigation map, instrument panel, and center stack. The second-row seats are a little firm and the two-seat third row should be reserved for kids only (I made the mistake of trying to fit my 6-foot self back there). I wish a head-up display, more interior ambient lighting, and a power-folding third row were offered. The adaptive cruise control system works like a charm but the lane centering system is not as advanced as some and will ping pong between lanes without substantial driver input—somewhat defeating the purpose of the system. The MDX also blends in with other large crossovers; it doesn't have a distinctive look, but our tester's black wheels did look cool."
2019,Acura,"The 2019 Acura ILX runs great, gets good mileage, powerful enough 4 cyl engine. Only drawbacks are particular to me as the CD player does NOT display the song titles or times. Weird. The windshield gets a little fogged up at night in damp weather and will not clear unless the defog blower runs on it for over 5 minutes. Strange clouds of fog seem to be inside the glass as I cannot wipe from inside or outside the windshield. This is my 7th Acura and the first with this issue. But seats are very comfortable. Headroom a bit tight for me at 6""3"". Trunk is a bit small."
2009,Alfa,
2010,Alfa,"The Alfa Romeo Giulietta is offered in five-door hatchback form only, so from a practicality point of view things look promising. There’s ample head and leg room for anyone in the front or the rear. Where the Giulietta falls down is with the boot space because it can stow just 350 litres, and all of 750 litres with the seats folded this jumps to all of 750 litres. This compares with the five-door BMW 1 series, which can hold a much more useful 1150 litres with the rear seats stowed, but just 330 litres with them in place."
2011,Alfa,"Sparkling handling should be the hallmark of any Alfa Romeo, but sadly for the Brera that’s not the case here. The car is too heavy, there’s too much body roll and the car feels awkward when pushed hard through bends. However, the steering is accurate and the ride on 17-inch alloys is more comfortable than you might expect. Posher versions get 18-inch alloys however, which firms up the ride."
2012,Alfa,
2013,Alfa,
2014,Alfa,"So far, we’ve only driven a 4C with the optional sports suspension kit and, with a very firm ride at low speeds, it leaves you in no doubt that this is an out-and-out driver’s car. It will certainly be too firm and uncomfortable for many people, but the benefits are obvious once you drive the car at the kind of pace it’s designed for. It feels wonderfully agile and balanced in the bends, with just slight turns of the wheel enough to get the nose angling in to the apex of each corner. It’s more Lotus than Porsche in its racecar-for-the road feel, but overall it’s a tremendously rewarding an exciting car to drive."
2015,Alfa,"The company is keen to play on its sporty roots and claims the Giulia will have “the most direct steering in its class”, part of which is said to be down to the weight distribution. Alfa has mounted the Giulia’s engine and gearbox behind the front axle and as close to the centre of the car as possible to even out the weight. There’s also an advanced suspension system, with a multi-link rear axle, a double wishbone set-up at the front and adaptive dampers."
2016,Alfa,"The new Alfa Romeo Giulia is an all-new compact saloon designed to take on big-hitters from Audi and BMW, with a focus on styling and dynamic thrills. Can it live up to the hype?"
2017,Alfa,"I have 7k miles on my 2017. There have been two recalls for software updates but no mechanical issues whatsoever. This is a great small sedan, agile, comfortable, fast and beautiful. Best steering, shifting and suspension of any non sports car that I have owned. Flat out beats the 7 and 5 series BMWs I have owned as well as the Jaguar XKR, and MB E cars I have owned. One minor complaint- the front seat a bit to short but understandable from a design viewpoint. Again, no mechanical issues at all. I love this car."
2018,Alfa,"Alfa Romeo definitively put an Italian twist on the SUV formula with its bold and distinctive Stelvio and it’s always impressed with its combination of spirited driving dynamics and practicality. With this updated version and refreshed model line-up Alfa Romeo hopes complaints about interior quality and outdated technology will also have been answered, the new Veloce model providing a link between the regular range and the fire-breathing Quadrifoglio flagship."
2019,Alfa,
2010,BMW,"The boot is massive, with 570-litres of storage space on offer, and flattening the rear seats opens up 1,450 litres. The high-riding position and good rear-headroom coupled with supportive seats means the BMW X6 is a comfortable cruiser. However, the high rear window combined with the X6’s bulk means maneuvering it around towns and car parks can prove tricky – our test car came with proximity sensors which show up on the centrally-mounted screen."
2010,BMW,"The BMW 3 Series is renowned for its handling, and the Coupe does not disappoint. The steering feels satisfyingly heavy, while the chassis offers up monumental grip, the electronic stability control and traction control systems keeping the handling very safe.  It’s just as happy snaking through town as it is sweeping through fast B roads thanks to its near perfect 50:50 weight distribution. The M Sport suspension does a fantastic job of keeping the rear wheels planted and the front wheels fluid, you won’t even realise you’re on BMW’s infamous ride-hardening run-flat tyres."
2011,BMW,"The BMW 3-Series also has great safety ratings. The 3-Series' available engines denote trim level. The base 328i's engine makes 230 horsepower, while the turbocharged 335i produces 300 horsepower. The base 328i sedan earns a fuel economy rating of 18/28 mpg city/highway"
2011,BMW,"Best vehicle I've ever owned. Never in the shop except for standard maintenance. Don't believe the lies about these cars being unreliable - I'm about to cross the 100,000 mark and it still drives like the day I bought it - Luxury, speed, reliability; don't wait to own your dream car. The trick is finding an honest european mechanic - don't let yourself be over charged to work on this vehicle."
2012,BMW,"The 6 Series Coupe has a highly adjustable driving position, with electric seats and a steering wheel which adjusts for reach and rake. Legroom isn’t as good as the size of the car would suggest, but there’s now the four-door 6 Series Gran Coupe if that’s your priority. It has a large 460-litre boot, which is big enough for three bags of golf clubs according to BMW."
2012,BMW,"The electric steering is one of the best around; very accurate and reasonably feelsome. In terms of fuel economy, the new 3's low weight, eight-speed gearbox, automatic stop-start and intelligent Eco Pro mode all contribute significantly to making this the most efficient car in its class"
2013,BMW,"BMW designers continue the tricks inside as well. New seats mean your butt rides closer to the floor, but the instrument cowl also sits higher on the dash to heighten the sensation of sitting low in the car."
2013,BMW,"Excellent ride/handling balance.
powerful and fuel-efficient engines.
upscale cabin.
elegant hardtop convertible design.
Limited interior storage space.
new sedan is less involving to drive than carryover models.
ActiveHybrid3 lacks typical hybrid efficiency."
2014,BMW,"If BMW's grand ambition for electric drive cars were an image, it might be one of those magnificent Hubble Space Telescope photos of a cloud-like galaxy punctuated by sparkling white dots. In BMW's case, the dots are ideas -- many of them utterly brilliant -- with the whole, delicate structure held together by gravities of imagination and logic that complement the company's boldness."
2014,BMW,"The 2014 BMW 3 Series has terrific power and a smooth ride with nimble handling. Inside, you’ll find more user-friendly tech and rear-seat room than most rivals."
2015,BMW,"Historically the BMW 3 Series has been regarded as the epitome of the compact premium sports sedan segment â€” a segment it created. Although the current F30 generation car seems to have replaced some of its sport with luxury, the 3 Series is still the standard of the segment."
2015,BMW,"An elegant cabin, outstanding handling, and strong engines push the 2015 BMW 3 Series to the top half of the luxury small car class."
2016,BMW,"The 2016 BMW 3 Series has muscular engines, nimble handling, and adult-friendly rear seats. Still, its below-class-average reliability rating keeps this luxury small car from finishing higher in our rankings."
2016,BMW,"For 2016, BMW has really improved the 3 series, particularly the 328i model. I was very impressed with the handling, and interior upgrades. The steering still has an artificial feel, but it is very precise and they have fixed the handling issues of the early models of this generation."
2017,BMW,"2017 BMW i3 Range: Some second-generation EVs, such as the 2017 BMW i3 Range-Extender (REx) I've spent the past few weeks driving, are the beneficiaries of advancement in battery chemistry, upping their ranges above 100 miles per charge and into third-generation EV territory."
2017,BMW,"The 2017 BMW 3 Series' splendid driving dynamics and spacious interior help earn it a spot in the top third of our luxury small car rankings. However, its weak base engine and lack of standard safety features hold it back."
2018,BMW,"2018 BMW 640i: A BMW with a Difference. The 6 GT is 2.4 inches taller than either sedan, reflecting BMW's emphasis on creating a roomier interior with a higher H-point than in its regular four doors, though more than eight-tenths of an inch has been trimmed from the roofline compared with the old 5 GT. The new car looks the better for it, frankly, swoopier and sportier, especially because there's less crown in the roof at the rear of the car, and the rear pillars flow into a tail that's less truncated."
2018,BMW,"The 2018 BMW 3 Series ranks in the top half of the competitive luxury small car class. The 3 Series has a roomy and quality cabin, enjoyable handling, zippy acceleration, and user-friendly features."
2019,BMW,"BMW’s fresh take on the 1 Series formula adopts the more conventional front-wheel drive layout of its rivals, with the goal of improved interior space and practicality. Technology has also been expanded, with increased connectivity and expanded infotainment functionality. This, combined with a slick reinterpretation of BMW’s traditionally sporty handling, adds up to a compelling premium hatchback"
2010,Chevrolet,"Chevrolet have chosen ride quality over handling dynamics in the Cruze, which means it is very smooth and quiet over most surfaces. There’s very little wind noise on the move and the diesel engine is quiet at a steady speed. It lacks the sharp steering we’ve come to expect from this class of car – the Cruze has little feedback and too much play in the steering. Body roll is well contained however."
2010,Chevrolet,"The Chevrolet Spark has a reasonably firm ride, but it won’t send every bump through to the cabin. There is some body roll through corners, but the car finds good grip and feels relatively nimble – partly thanks to the fact that it’s relatively lightweight. However, there’s no getting away from the fact that other city cars provide a better balance of abilities."
2011,Chevrolet,"The 2011 Chevrolet Camaro has agile handling and a powerful base engine, but reviewers said that the Camaro’s interior is cramped and features too many cheap plastic surfaces.

"
2011,Chevrolet,"The Chevrolet Orlando MPV shares the same platform as the soon-to-be-released Vauxhall Zafira. Handling is surprisingly neat and agile for an MPV, the car resisting roll well, though you’ll note the suspension is on the firmer side. It doesn’t have that combination of ride suppleness and steering finesse we’ve experienced in the Ford Grand C-MAX, but nor does it have the light steering aloofness of the Citroen Grand C4 Picasso. The box-like proportions of the Chevrolet Orlando, including the big square door mirrors, also make this MPV surprisingly easy to manoeuvre. At higher speeds, it’s worth noting we experienced a significant amount of wind noise which is to be expected when the car you are driving is shaped like a slightly elongated brick."
2012,Chevrolet,"While some critics felt its interior could be nicer, the 2012 Chevrolet Camaro ultimately won them over with its poised handling and powerful engine choices."
2012,Chevrolet,"The Volt is a smooth car to drive in most situations, but its suspension can thump into potholes and bumps. Thanks to the batteries being placed the length of the cabin, it doesn’t feel too nose or tail heavy and corners with a fair amount of grip. The steering is light and the Volt is happy cruising at higher speeds too."
2013,Chevrolet,"The 2013 Chevrolet Camaro ranks high among sports cars thanks to its engaging performance, great reliability rating, and high safety score."
2013,Chevrolet,"Chevrolet is renowned as a budget brand, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be disappointed by the Trax’s standard equipment. On the contrary, even the most basic model has alloy wheels, Bluetooth, air-conditioning, cruise control, automatic headlights and electric front windows. Step up to LT trim, and you also get smarter styling, more storage, electric rear windows and Chevrolet’s upgraded infotainment system, which allows you to plug in a smartphone and run its various functions through a full-colour touch-screen. It’s a neat system, providing sat-nav (and a host of other functions) for a fraction of the cost of a built-in unit, and a real selling point for the car."
2014,Chevrolet,"The 2014 Chevrolet Camaro ranks in the top half of the sports car class. Its best trait is its perfect safety score. However, the lower trims can’t compete with rivals when it comes to handling, and its cramped interior has too many hard plastics. "
2014,Chevrolet,"The 2014 Chevrolet Cruze Diesel will return fuel economy of 27/33/46 mpg (city/combined/highway) in EPA testing, the automaker announced today. That lofty highway number is the best of any non-hybrid passenger car sold in the U.S., and even beats out the Cruze Diesel's main rival, the Volkswagen Jetta TDI, though the VW gets higher ratings with city mileage."
2015,Chevrolet,"The 2015 Chevrolet Camaro offers agile handling and a lineup of strong engines, and it earns a good reliability rating. However, it is unremarkable in most other ways, including cabin quality and passenger space."
2015,Chevrolet,"Strong engine lineup
Athletic handling
Cheap cabin materials
Poor outward visibility
Small trunk opening"
2016,Chevrolet,"The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro ranks near the top of the sports car class thanks to its excellent reliability rating, thrilling performance, and feature-filled interior."
2016,Chevrolet,"2016 Chevrolet Cruze: The new Chevrolet Cruze makes a good first impression—not something that could always be said of a Chevy compact car. The warm two-tone interior of our 2016 Cruze Premier four-door sedan test car is downright inviting and belies the fact that this is still considered an entry-level car. The Cruze is nicely loaded with one of the best infotainment systems in the business, heated seats and steering wheel, remote start, and a seamless stop-start system. Consumers might be pleasantly surprised with how much they can get for less than $25,000"
2017,Chevrolet,"Despite having great performance and intuitive features, the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ranks in the middle of a tight-knit class. It has high ownership costs compared to rivals, and it comes up short on rear-seat and cargo space."
2017,Chevrolet,"Chevrolet is now in the game with the first Cruze hatchback for the U.S., starting at $23,065 for the LT. U.S. finally gets a Cruze hatchback amid growing popularity for the versatile body style"
2018,Chevrolet,"The 2018 Chevrolet Camaro ranks near the top of the sports car class, thanks to its muscular engine performance, rewarding handling, above-average predicted reliability rating, and good safety scores. The Camaro’s cramped rear seats and poor rearward visibility keep it from ranking higher."
2018,Chevrolet,"Once we were done at the track, we took the 2018 Cruze out on the road to see how it performs as a daily commuter on the streets of Los Angeles. One of the Cruze's standout features is its comfortable ride. The suspension does a great job isolating the cabin from potholes and bumps found across Los Angeles' less than perfect roads. With the optional 18-inch alloy wheels that come with the RS package on the diesel hatchback and the gas-powered Premier trims, the car does get unsettled over large imperfections. Like the Cruze Premier, the Cruze TD with the RS package comes with a Watt's linkage rear suspension (Z-link in GM speak), which helps it ride better than variants with the more common torsion beam."
2019,Chevrolet,"The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro finishes in the top half of our sports car rankings. It's athletic and fun to drive, and it has a decent interior (but rivals are more upscale inside). Add it all up, and you've got a well-rounded performance machine."
2019,Chevrolet," I am completely in love with my 2019 Blazer! It has a nice, sleek exterior design and appears huge on the inside. There is a lot of leg room in the back, even if the front seats are all the way back. I love the all leather dashboard. It’s a smooth ride and isn’t as loud as the equinox when accelerating."
2009,Genesis,"All-in-all, I'm pleased with the Genesis. It is a good, solid car with one of the best warranties in the auto business. Toyota, Honda and Nissan have nothing that comes even REMOTELY close to it in sportiness. It felt a lot like what I'd expect a Korean Mustang to feel like. I give Hyundai credit for going after the sporty car customers. Heaven knows, no other Asian manufacturer does."
2009,Genesis,
2010,Genesis,
2010,Genesis,
2011,Genesis,"This car handles sharp turns well.The acceleration of the car was good, and it has automatic handle shift gear.Front seat of the car is good, good trunk space. However, The car does not drive that great in the winter, due to it being rear wheel drive.Back seats are too low, and there's not enough head space. I use to drive a sedan, and wish the car had more space."
2011,Genesis,"Hyundai Genesis Coupe Premium: Car always loses alignment. Drinks gas like a V8, although I drive normally and don't rev. Transmission line leaked and manual shifter stopped working at 18,000 km (11184 miles) due to a design flaw in the front compartment. Transmission always jumps from 1 to 2. Beware of a design flaw with the transmission cooler system. Can rupture easily. Will think twice before buying a Hyundai again."
2012,Genesis,
2012,Genesis,
2013,Genesis,"All in all, it was very comfortable to drive. The interior is well done - the stitching on the brown leather seats was attractive. The seat adjusted well and I could drive for hours without much discomfort. The dash had a strange appearance. There's a large shiny wood grain panel on the passenger side that reflects light. I found it distracting, as passing streetlights, etc. would reflect into my eyes. I found the engine to have adequate power and passing wasn't a concern. The trans shifted smoothly. Only got low to mid 20's for fuel mileage though, with mostly highway driving at 70 - 80 mph. My 96 Saab gets high 20's in my daily driving and mid 30's highway."
2013,Genesis,
2014,Genesis,"The more I drive this Genesis, the more I like it. I had not intended on buying a new one at all, but at the end of the year a small town Texas dealer knocked off $9,000 off MSRP and I bought the new one."
2014,Genesis,"Hyundai Genesis Coupe R-Spec 2.0: None! This car has been phenomenal and hasn't seen a single dealer visit since purchase. I get oil changes at a local shop and drive. This car gets attention like no other, with no shortage of lengthy gas station conversations with strangers. People even take pictures of it on the highway, and it's always fun to watch other drivers crank their head around to take a look. The car was great when stock, and even better when modified. I didn't do much to the exterior, other than a nice set of BBS wheels, lowering springs and window tint, but the drive train got a nice reworking with an after market turbocharger and supporting modifications, which makes for a monstrous daily driver. The roads just disappear at an alarming rate, and the chassis is well composed while eating it up."
2015,Genesis,"Hyundai Genesis Coupe GT 3.8: The car looks awesome. Drives nice IF you drive slow. I had other performance cars. My Genesis Coupe 3.8GT lacks the handling of a sports coupe. I tried accelerating several times, and it swayed to the right and nearly caused me accidents. So, I have a sports car that I cannot even use to accelerate as the handling is so very poor. My tires have good tread. In snow the handling is awful even with good snow tires and rims. I can hardly wait to pay off my car loan and trade it for another car, may be a Lexus ISF or IS350 or something. I have to drive this sports car like an old man on the highway, as the drive is so unpredictable."
2015,Genesis,
2016,Genesis,"The car is rear wheel drive, as all cars should be, and the driving is slick and well balanced. The steering has just the correct weight and feel and adds a confidence to the drive. It uses an electric motor to assist. The brakes are light and very effective, considering it's a 2 ton car. The cornering is flat and assured. The layout of the dash is just great and the radio/nav unit is high on the dash where it should be, and is easy to read and use. A second LCD between the speedo and tacho gauges gives a load of reassuring information regarding the state of the car. There are a load of high tech gizmos that are too many to mention. I will mention the smart cruise which will follow the speed of the car in front right down to stopping. This car scored the highest safety score with a well known test agency that tests all cars and has the highest record score. Don't believe me, then Google. Here in the UK we get just one model that comes fully loaded, and even has extra features not on the USA Ultimate model, like auto parking for example. We also get cameras all around that give a bird's eye view to assist parking or checking proximity with other vehicles. Just amazing, it looks like a view from about 30ft above the car from a drone or something."
2016,Genesis,
2017,Genesis,
2017,Genesis,"Although the G90 is just a nose behind the LS 500 at the track, it couldn't feel more different on the road. Everything about the Genesis G90 is as smooth as a Marvin Gaye ballad. Its engine and transmission are particularly noteworthy for how effortless they make the process of driving."
2018,Genesis,
2018,Genesis,"Genesis G80 Sport takes a very different path from its older brother by focusing on performance over plushness. The result is what often feels like a strange mix of sports car and comfortable cruiser. Packing a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6, the G80 produces a very healthy 365 hp routed to the rear wheels. It's powerful enough that I didn't imagine myself wanting the G80 with the 420-hp V-8 engine, and even the base 3.8-liter V-6 with 311 hp might prove more than enough. But despite the plentiful power of our tester, the weight and steering feel suggest ambitions other than raw performance."
2019,Genesis,"2019 Genesis G70: A better sport sedan than its direct competitors, just a shade off those costing much more. What we are rapidly finding is that, in a performance-per-dollar equation, the Genesis G70 3.3T is one of the best values on the market."
2019,GMC,"2019 GMC Sierra :  the 2019 Sierra is huge, becoming the largest truck in the segment alongside the Silverado. The box is 7.0 inches wider and also deeper. Sierra's 62.9-cubic-foot short box offers more volume than standard boxes in the Ford F-150 or Ram 1500. It distinguishes itself with a multicolor 3 x 7-inch head-up display and second-generation rear-camera mirror with buttons to adjust brightness, zoom in and out, or switch to a conventional mirror."
2019,Honda ,"Honda Civic EX: Very clever design and very spacious. The car has really good space in the rear, once you get in via the quite small rear doors. Leg and headroom is very good for this type of car, probably about the best there was, I reckon.                                                       Overall - great family car (if you accept it's got small back doors), very clever and stylish cabin, lots of space. Nice to use, easy to drive, fairly low tax and good MPG - BUT - if you are interested in a really good driving car, like me... a possible let down."
2019,Hyundai,"Hyundai Sonata 2.4: Large car and spacious car with plenty of front and rear leg room even for tall drivers/passengers, but limited head room. Seat comfort below average and sitting position too low to the floor. Seats are rather hard and flat shaped. Vague steering especially on the highway - not very relaxed driving on long distances. Quiet interior. Spacious trunk. Weak 2.4 non turbo engine under hard acceleration (passing) and not very economical in city driving, but good mileage on the highway. Average cabin heating and cooling - perhaps not the best choice in very hot climates. Good warranty."
2019,Genesis,"If you can deal with (or prefer?) rear-wheel drive, this is an amazing vehicle, and a fairly well kept secret. The 3.8 engine is wonderfully silky smooth, and very powerful. This car passes in a heartbeat, and will keep up with Charger RT hemi's on the highway (not kidding). Gas mileage is fair, and my wife achieved 30 MPG on the highway on a 5 hour trip; I generally average 24 MPG in mixed driving... not bad for a car that is every-bit a BMW or Mercedes in style and performance. "
2019,Ford," Ford Escape XLT 2.5 : I really didn't want to like this car. It was purchased out of necessity. I was in a situation where I had to take what was available to me at the time, and this was it.
It's not necessarily powerful, has a lot of body roll in corners, and is frankly boring. There's nothing about the vehicle that I find exciting. However, it's by far one of the most reliable cars I've ever owned. For that, I sing its praises. It's never had any problems that left me stranded. It hasn't had problems that were unexpected due to its mileage. Over 161,000 miles now and it's still going strong, without any signs of slowing down."
2019,BMW,"The BMW 3 Series is known as a driver's car, and the redesigned 2019 3 Series sedan continues that tradition. Among its improvements are a more powerful base engine, sharper handling, and more interior space. It places in the top half of our luxury small car rankings."
