    "Personal Expense Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s fast-paced world, individuals need to track and manage their expenses effectively. Your task is to build a personal expense tracker that allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against a monthly budget. The tracker should also be able to save and load expenses from a file for future reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "1.    Design and implement a personal expense tracker that enables users to manage their expenses\n",
    "2.    Allow users to categorize expenses and set monthly budgets\n",
    "3.    Implement file-handling functionality to save and load expense data\n",
    "4.    Create an interactive, menu-driven interface for ease of use\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Add an expense:\n",
    "•  Create a function to prompt the user for expense details. Ensure you ask for:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The date of the expense in the format YYYY-MM-DD\n",
    "        The category of the expense, such as Food or Travel\n",
    "        The amount spent\n",
    "        A brief description of the expense\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the date, category, amount, and description as key-value pairs\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "{'date': '2024-09-18', 'category': 'Food', 'amount': 15.50, 'description': 'Lunch with friends'}\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  View expenses:\n",
    "•   Write a function to retrieve and display all stored expenses\n",
    "      Ensure the function loops through the list of expenses and displays the date, category, amount, and description for each entry\n",
    "•   Validate the data before displaying it\n",
    "      If any required details (date, category, amount, or description) are missing, skip the entry or notify the user that it’s incomplete\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Set and track the budget:\n",
    "•   Create a function that allows the user to input a monthly budget. Prompt the user to:\n",
    "     Enter the total amount they want to budget for the month\n",
    "•   Create another function that calculates the total expenses recorded so far\n",
    "     Compare the total with the user’s monthly budget\n",
    "     If the total expenses exceed the budget, display a warning (Example: You have exceeded your budget!)\n",
    "     If the expenses are within the budget, display the remaining balance (Example: You have 150 left for the month)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Save and load expenses:\n",
    "•   Implement a function to save all expenses to a CSV file, with each row containing the date, category, amount, and description of each expense\n",
    "•   Create another function to load expenses from the CSV file. When the program starts, it should:\n",
    "     Read the saved data from the file\n",
    "     Load it back into the list of expenses so the user can see their previous expenses and continue from where they left off\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Create an interactive menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Build a function to display a menu with the following options:\n",
    "        Add expense\n",
    "        View expenses\n",
    "        Track budget\n",
    "        Save expenses\n",
    "        Exit\n",
    "    Allow the user to enter a number to choose an option\n",
    "    •   Implement the following conditions:\n",
    "         If the user selects option 1, call the function to add an expense\n",
    "         If the user selects option 2, call the function to view expenses\n",
    "         If the user selects option 3, call the function to track the budget\n",
    "         If the user selects option 4, call the function to save expenses to the file\n",
    "         If the user selects option 5, save the expenses and exit the program\n",
    "\n"
